We all have heard blockchain stories. Stories that redefined the way
businesses operate. Stories that created new business across the domains.
Stories that propelled innovation. Stories that are defining the future
of technology. Stories that helped others run their business in decentralized
fashion. And a lot more.

Blockchain technology has seen increasingly wider adoption across the
industries. Digital transformation of businesses and innovation in the
healthcare industry have seen unprecedented demand like never before
during the challenging times of COVID-19. What seemed impossible in
the past is now turning to be reality.

The Hyperledger India Chapter aimed to bridge the gap between the blockchain
technology enthusiasts and the blockchain technology experts.
